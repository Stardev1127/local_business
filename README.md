# ReserVAMOS

ReserVAMOS is a web application meant to support local business. Users get a list of local businesses close to their current location and create reservations. In more detail, clients have access to the location on the map of the store and its details and are allowed to create reservations. Business owners can create an account and register their own business.

```
brew install yarn
```

- Open a terminal window and in the root folder type to deploy the front-end of the application

```
cd front
yarn start
```

- Open another terminal window and in the root folder type to deploy the back-end of the application
